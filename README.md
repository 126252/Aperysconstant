# Aperysconstant

fun fact the reason for #_=% is because them keys are broken.

so when I did a size of a 100 I got:

  1st:
	
    Apérys constant:  1.2020569031595942
    Apérys constant ish:  1.1494252873563218
    processing time: 77.515625s
		
  2nd:
	
    Apérys constant:  1.2020569031595942
    Apérys constant ish:  1.2345679012345678
    processing time: 76.796875s
   
I would do more but as you can see it takes of a minute each time. so do it your self.
